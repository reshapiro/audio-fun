This repository includes several convenience shell scripts for flac and sox

<h1>flac</h1>
The flac scripts are designed to manage tags for virtual 'albums' in the form of a directory of flac files,
 without having to use the excessively convoluted metaflac commands.

There are scripts to generate an initial set of tags based on the directory and file names, and to load, save and update existing tags very easily.

You must have the <em>flac</em> package installed, including <em>metaflac</em>, to use these scripts. 

<h1>sox</h1>
The sox scripts are designed for easy re-sampling. For now there's only one which would typically be used to down-sample a directory of hi-def audio files

to 16/44.1 or 16/48k for use with players or DACs that only support  CD audio.

You must have the <em>sox</em> package installed to use this script.
