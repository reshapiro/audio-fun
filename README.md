This repository includes several convenience shell scripts for metaflac and sox, specifically:
Specifically there are scripts to

<h1>Generate a directory of tags files from a directory of flac files.</h1>
<h1>Import each file in a tags directory to the corresponding flac file a parallel directory of flac files.</h1>
<h1>View all tags in a directory of flac files.</h1>
<h1> Downsample a directory of hi-def audio files to a parallel directory of 16/44.1 files.</h1>

Originally much of this was written in Java. That's still around but deprecated.
